# XGenomes - Binary Classification of T7 and lambda phage
From Boston University CS542 Final Project in Collaboration with XGenomes.

## Getting started
First download all packages below:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- scipy
- PIL
- Tensorflow
- Keras

These packages are used to run our ML model.

## Structure
setup.py is a preprocessing file

cnn.py is our network architecture

predict.py loads our model and predicts an input image.

## Quickstart
To use our program download the pretrained model from the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_NJTtDb9WLfScMmRH0KtgVX529m9dWl/view?usp=sharing

and run predict.py using 
```
python predict.py
```
